# Kotlin - implement copy method for interfaces

## Problem description
We often use interfaces to define a contract for a set of our classes in Object Oriented Programming. Sometimes the implementing classes are 
[data classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html) that have powerful methods like `copy` and `equals` and it is also common to declare properties as `val`
in order to make them immutable. Furthermore, not only `data` but also regular classes 
([why wouldn't I make every eligible class a data class?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39650646/why-wouldnt-i-make-every-eligable-kotlin-class-a-data-class)) 
may implement the interface that do not have the `copy` method by default.
Adding these two features we end up with immutable classes that conform to a common interface, but we
are not able to handle them uniformly, which makes us to retrieve the actual types of our objects each time and either 
invoke the `copy` method on them or modify them on some other way.

## Examples
The `Fruit` interface declares the `name`, `color` and `taste` properties as `val`, and the implementing classes
extend this model with an appropriate property for demonstration.
The `Fruit` interface is implemented by the `Apple`, `Banana` and `Tomato` classes, the former two are `data` classes,
the latter is a regular one.
In the following we will update the `name` property of our `Fruit` objects. 

### 1 - Updating the `name` property without the defining the `copy` method on the `Fruit` interface

#### 1.1 - Using the `when` construct
We can define a conditional expression with multiple branches using Kotlin's 
[when construct](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/control-flow.html#when-expression).
It's useful to combine it with the [is and !is operators](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/typecasts.html#is-and-is-operators).

#### 1.2 - Using subclasses

TODO

### 2 - Updating the `name` property with the `copy` method on the `Fruit` interface

#### 2.1 - Using methods

TODO

#### 2.2 - Using a generic class

TODO
